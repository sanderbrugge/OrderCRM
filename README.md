# Launching simulators

## launch the iOS simulator

For iOS you need to have Xcode and an iOS simulator installed. Otherwise the script wont be able to launch a simulator.

There are yarn scripts available for quickly launching the application. For starting the simulator and the application, simply run:

```
$ yarn run ios
```

First time setup will take a while, but once that's done you can enable hot reloading by shaking the device (cmd + d) and enabling 'Hot Reload'.
